- Number Variables Store numbers . Object Variables store references

- You can convert from a class type to an interface type, provided the class implements the interface

older versions

- An inner class can access surrounding local variables only if they are declared as final.

  - Keep in mind that an object variable is final when the variable
    always refers to the same object. The state of the object can change,
    but the variable canâ€™t refer to a different object

- An inner class can also access instance variables of the surrounding class,
  again with a restriction. The instance variable must belong to the object
  that constructed the inner class object. If the inner class object was created inside a static method, it can only access static variables.

- A subclass has no access to the private instance variables of the superclass
- A subclass method overrides a superclass method if it has the same name and parameter types as a superclass method
